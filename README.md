# markdown-resume

**Update Nov. 2022:** _This repository has not been updated for some time and no longer contains accurate contents or recommended best patterns. If you're interested in what I'm working on, please check out the rest of my [Github profile](https://github.com/drboyer) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drboyer/)._

This repository contains my resumes and a quick tool I built to convert them from 
Markdown, style them with a CSS stylesheet, and save them as a PDF.

The repo contains a Vagrantfile that brings up a basic Ubuntu box with this
app ready to npm install and run.
